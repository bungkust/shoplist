			<p>We may collect anonymous usage data and crash reports through third-party services (like Google Play Services) to help us improve the App's stability and performance. This data is not linked to your personal identity.</p>

			<h3>4. Data Security</h3>
			<p>
				The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
